# SuGoJS

SuGoJS is a highly modular, increidibly leightweight and simple HTTP micro-framework.

## SuGoJS Development Manifest

SuGoJS follows a set of development standards
 
- Minium dependencies: Given the sheer size of the NPM ecosystem, it is easy to deliver every solution with a third-party module, but many times those same modulos do not fit our needs or maybe you are just bringing a gun to a knife fight. With SuGoJS we aimed to use as less dependencies in the development of each module as possible, forcing us to be better developers and to find solutions by our selfs. We do not believe in "pure minimalism", so we do use third party packages when it is necessary. Also, having a lot of dependencies for your project can make your own project more vulnerable, as it depends on many uncoordinated sources.
- Simplier is better 
- Do One Thing, Do It Well: 
- NodeJS and Express Compatible:
- More Control, Less Magic:
